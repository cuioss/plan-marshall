# Guide B

Secondary reference documentation for testing.

## Overview

This guide provides additional standards and patterns.

## Code Standards

All code must follow these standards:

1. Use meaningful variable names
2. Add comments for complex logic
3. Follow the single responsibility principle
4. Write unit tests for all public methods

These standards ensure code quality and maintainability.

## Error Handling

Handle errors according to these guidelines:

- Use specific exception types
- Log errors with context
- Provide user-friendly messages
- Never swallow exceptions silently

Proper error handling improves debugging.

## Performance Guidelines

Optimize code following these patterns:

- Avoid premature optimization
- Profile before optimizing
- Cache expensive computations
- Use appropriate data structures

Performance matters for user experience.
