# Project Lifecycle Integration

Standards for integrating requirements documentation throughout the project lifecycle.

## Initial Project Setup

During initial project setup:

1. Create documentation structure **before** implementing core functional components (business logic, APIs, main features)
2. Define requirements based on project goals
3. Create specifications with architectural overview and design approach
4. Use specifications to guide implementation planning

## Documentation-First Approach

New projects must establish their documentation structure before implementing core functional components (i.e., before writing business logic, APIs, or main feature code). This ensures:

- Clear understanding of project goals and scope through documented and approved requirements
- Traceability from the start
- Consistent documentation practices
- Foundation for implementation guidance

## During Implementation

As implementation progresses:

1. Update specifications with detailed design decisions
2. Add implementation links as code is written
3. Update requirement status indicators
4. Keep cross-references current

## Post-Implementation

After features are implemented:

1. Update specifications to mark sections as IMPLEMENTED
2. Add links to implementation classes
3. Add links to test classes
4. Remove redundant pre-implementation examples
5. Ensure traceability is complete
