"""Single-source canonical resolver for manifest step keys.

Every write and read of a step record — ``mark-step-done`` (manage-status),
``assert-step-recorded`` (manage-status), ``record-step`` (manage-execution-
manifest), and every manifest-internal boundary-normalization call site — routes
its step id through :func:`canonicalize_step_key` so the write key and the read
key are computed identically. A genuine prefix mismatch then fails loud instead
of being silently tolerated by a near-miss verdict, and a bare-vs-``default:``
variant reconciles to the same canonical key.

Canonicalization has two composed operations, applied in order:

1. **Default-prefix strip** — a leading ``default:`` prefix is stripped to the
   bare manifest key (``default:push`` → ``push``).
2. **Promoted built-in alias map** — a ``{bundle}:{skill}`` id that was promoted
   out of a former built-in finalize doc into a top-level bundle skill
   (:data:`PROMOTED_BUILTIN_STEP_IDS`) maps to its bare built-in name
   (``plan-marshall:automatic-review`` → ``automatic-review``).

Applying the strip before the map lookup makes the resolver idempotent in a
single call even for a doubly-prefixed input such as
``default:plan-marshall:automatic-review``, which strips to
``plan-marshall:automatic-review`` and then maps to ``automatic-review``.

Every other id — ``project:`` steps, genuinely opt-in ``{bundle}:{skill}`` steps
(e.g. ``plan-marshall:plan-retrospective``) — is preserved verbatim so the
dispatcher still routes it as a typed step. The function is idempotent: it is a
fixed point on any already-canonical input.

This module is pure (no I/O, no subprocess, no git) and stdlib-only, and lives at
the ``script-shared/scripts/`` top level so every consuming bundle imports it by
bare name (``from _step_key_canonical import canonicalize_step_key``).

# machinery must treat the bundle-prefixed id and its bare form identically.
# Genuinely opt-in ``{bundle}:{skill}`` steps (e.g. ``plan-marshall:plan-
