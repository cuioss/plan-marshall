# Phase Finalize Skill

**Role**: Finalize phase skill. Handles shipping workflow (commit, push, PR) and plan completion. Verification tasks have already been executed within phase-5-execute.

**Key Pattern**: Shipping-focused execution. No verification steps—all quality checks run as verification tasks within phase-5-execute before reaching this phase.

**Required steps declaration**: This skill opts in to the `phase_steps_complete` handshake invariant. The canonical list of steps that MUST be marked done on `status.metadata.phase_steps["6-finalize"]` before the phase transitions is maintained in [standards/required-steps.md](standards/required-steps.md). Each built-in step's standards document terminates with a `manage-status mark-step-done` call whose `--step` value matches an entry in that file.

## Enforcement

> **Shared lifecycle patterns**: See [phase-lifecycle.md](../ref-workflow-architecture/standards/phase-lifecycle.md) for entry protocol, completion protocol, and error handling convention.

**Execution mode**: Follow workflow steps sequentially, respecting config gates. Each config-gated step dispatches to a standards/ document.

**Required skill load** (before any operation):
```
Skill: plan-marshall:dev-general-practices
Skill: plan-marshall:workflow-integration-git
Skill: plan-marshall:tools-integration-ci
```

**Prohibited actions:**
- Never access `.plan/` files directly — all access must go through `python3 .plan/execute-script.py` manage-* scripts
- Never execute a step that is NOT listed in `manifest.phase_6.steps`. The manifest is the single authority — there is no fallback to a default step set, no inference from `marshal.json` config booleans, no per-step skip logic.
- Never skip phase transitions — use `manage-status transition`, never set status directly
- Never improvise script subcommands — use only those documented in this skill's workflow steps
- Never skip a step in the manifest list based on PR state, CI state, or earlier step outcomes. The ONLY valid skip condition is the resumable re-entry check (skip if already marked `done` from a previous invocation). Standards documents handle their own runtime state decisions inside their dispatched bodies.
- Never issue a raw `git` Bash call without `git -C {worktree_path}` (pre-worktree-removal) or `git -C {main_checkout}` (post-worktree-removal). No `cd` chaining, no implicit cwd. `{worktree_path}` and `{main_checkout}` MUST be resolved by the Step 0 entry step before any standards document runs.
- Never invoke a build, CI, Sonar, or GitHub/GitLab script (`ci`, `python_build`, `sonar`, `workflow-integration-*`) without forwarding `--project-dir {worktree_path}` (or `--project-dir {main_checkout}` after worktree removal). The executor is cwd-pass-through; cwd control is explicit at the call site.

**Constraints:**
- Strictly comply with all rules from dev-general-practices, especially tool usage and workflow step discipline

## When to Activate This Skill

Activate when:
- Execute phase has completed (all implementation and verification tasks passed)
- Ready to commit and potentially create PR
- Plan is in `6-finalize` phase

## Input Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `plan_id` | string | Yes | Plan identifier |
| `session_id` | string | Yes | Current Claude Code conversation ID — forwarded to `default:record-metrics` for `manage-metrics enrich`, which reads the matching transcript JSONL to capture main-context token usage. Without it, `enrich` cannot locate the transcript and session tokens are lost from the final report. |

### How to obtain session_id

Claude Code exposes `session_id` only in the JSON stdin payload delivered to hook invocations — it is **not** available via any environment variable or Bash command from a main-context skill run. The outer workflow obtains it by calling the resolver script, which reads a cache populated by the terminal-title hook on every `UserPromptSubmit`:

```bash
python3 .plan/execute-script.py plan-marshall:plan-marshall:manage_session current
```

Parse `session_id` from the TOON output. Resolution order: `~/.cache/plan-marshall/sessions/by-cwd/{sha256(cwd)}` → `~/.cache/plan-marshall/sessions/current` → `status: error\nerror: session_id_unavailable`. On error, the caller decides whether to abort finalize or degrade (skipping `enrich`); the contract here stays `Yes` / required and the caller is responsible for producing a valid value before dispatching this skill.

**Forbidden resolution patterns** (all trip the Bash sandbox or produce garbage):

- `echo "$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID"` — invented env-var name, not exposed by Claude Code; expansion triggers the `simple_expansion` sandbox heuristic and prompts the user
- `printenv`, `env | grep`, `$(...)` command substitution — forbidden by `workflows/planning.md` for the one env-var case it handles; same prohibition applies here
- Any other `$VAR` expansion — the **only** allow-listed env-var read pattern in plan-marshall is `echo "TERM_PROGRAM=$TERM_PROGRAM"` (installed by the marshall-steward wizard for IDE hand-off)

As a last resort (fresh checkout, stripped `.claude` config, hook has not fired yet), use `AskUserQuestion` to ask the user for the id — but prefer the resolver in every other case, since users typically do not know where to find the id in the Claude Code UI.

## Configuration Sources

The phase-6-finalize step list lives in the **per-plan execution manifest**, not in `marshal.json`. The manifest is composed at outline time by `plan-marshall:manage-execution-manifest:compose` and is the single source of truth for which steps fire on this plan.

**Manifest** (read in Step 2):

```bash
python3 .plan/execute-script.py plan-marshall:manage-execution-manifest:manage-execution-manifest \
  read --plan-id {plan_id}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `phase_6.steps` | list | Ordered list of bare step IDs to execute (e.g., `commit-push`, `create-pr`, …). Authoritative. |

**Cross-phase config from `marshal.json`** (read in Step 2 alongside the manifest):

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `phase-6-finalize.review_bot_buffer_seconds` | integer | Max seconds to wait after CI for new review-bot comments (used as `--timeout` for `pr wait-for-comments`; ceiling, not fixed delay; default: 180) |
| `phase-6-finalize.max_iterations` | integer | Maximum finalize-verify loops (default: 3) |
| `phase-5-execute.commit_strategy` | string | per_deliverable / per_plan / none |
| `phase-1-init.branch_strategy` | string | feature / direct |

A step is active if and only if it appears in `manifest.phase_6.steps`. Absent steps are NEVER executed. The order of steps in the manifest list is the execution order. The `plan.phase-6-finalize.steps` field in `marshal.json` is the *candidate set* — the input list `phase-4-plan` Step 8b passes to `manage-execution-manifest compose --phase-6-steps`. The manifest's `phase_6.steps` is the *resolved per-plan instance* of that candidate set and is the only authority this skill consults at dispatch time. The candidate set drives dispatch transitively; this skill itself never reads `marshal.json` for step selection.

---

## Step Types

Three step types are supported, distinguished by prefix notation:

| Type | Notation | Resolution |
|------|----------|------------|
| **built-in** | `default:` prefix (e.g., `default:commit-push`) | Strip prefix, read `standards/{name}.md` and follow all steps |
| **project** | `project:` prefix (e.g., `project:finalize-step-foo`) | `Skill: {notation}` with interface contract parameters |
| **skill** | fully-qualified `bundle:skill` (e.g., `pm-dev-java:java-post-pr`) | `Skill: {notation}` with interface contract parameters |

**Type detection logic**:
- Starts with `default:` -> built-in type (strip prefix, validate against dispatch table)
- Starts with `project:` -> project type
- Contains `:` (other) -> fully-qualified skill type

Each step declares an `order: <int>` value in its authoritative source — frontmatter on built-in standards docs (`standards/{name}.md`), frontmatter on project-local `SKILL.md` for `project:` steps, and the return-dict `order` field for extension-contributed skills. `marshall-steward` sorts the `steps` list by this value when writing it to `marshal.json`. This skill iterates the list as written and does NOT re-sort or validate `order` at runtime — the persisted order is the runtime order.

### Built-in Step Dispatch Table

| Step Name | Standards Document | Description |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| `default:commit-push` | `standards/commit-push.md` | Commit and push changes |
| `default:create-pr` | `standards/create-pr.md` | Create pull request |
| `default:automated-review` | `standards/automated-review.md` | CI automated review |
| `default:sonar-roundtrip` | `standards/sonar-roundtrip.md` | Sonar analysis roundtrip |
| `default:knowledge-capture` | `standards/knowledge-capture.md` | Capture learnings to memory |
| `default:lessons-capture` | `standards/lessons-capture.md` | Record lessons learned |
| `default:branch-cleanup` | `standards/branch-cleanup.md` | Branch cleanup — adapts to PR mode or local-only based on create-pr step presence |
| `default:review-knowledge` | `standards/review-knowledge.md` | Review existing lessons-learned and memories against plan changes; propose deletes/updates |
| `default:record-metrics` | `standards/record-metrics.md` | Record final plan metrics before archive |
| `default:archive-plan` | `standards/archive-plan.md` | Archive the completed plan |

### Interface Contract for External Steps

Project and skill steps receive these parameters:

```
Skill: {step_reference}
  Arguments: --plan-id {plan_id} --iteration {iteration} [--session-id {session_id}]
```

The step skill can access the plan's context via manage-* scripts (references, status, config).

#### Session-id forwarding

`--session-id {session_id}` is forwarded ONLY to external steps on the per-step opt-in whitelist below. The forwarding is opt-in (rather than universal) because some external steps may reject unknown flags; opting in keeps the contract additive for new dependencies without breaking existing steps.

| Whitelisted external step | Why it needs `--session-id` |
|---------------------------|------------------------------|
| `plan-marshall:plan-retrospective` | Aspect 12 (chat-history-analysis) is conditional on `--session-id`. Without it, the aspect is silently skipped and the retrospective report omits the chat-history section. See `plan-retrospective/SKILL.md` → "Input Contract" for the consumer-side declaration. |

`default:record-metrics` is intentionally NOT on this whitelist: it is a built-in step, dispatched via `standards/record-metrics.md`, which already consumes `--session-id` inline. The whitelist scope is project- and skill-type external steps only.

**How to apply** — when defining a new external step that consumes session-scoped state:

1. Declare `--session-id` as an input in the step's authoritative document (project step `SKILL.md` or fully-qualified skill `SKILL.md`/standards).
2. Add the fully-qualified step name to the whitelist table above.
3. Verify by running a finalize end-to-end and confirming the step does not hit a "session_id missing" code path.

The orchestrator is responsible for resolving `session_id` (see "How to obtain session_id" earlier in this file). This skill receives the resolved value via its Input Parameters and forwards it verbatim to whitelisted steps; it does not re-resolve.

**Required termination:** Every external step (project and fully-qualified skill) MUST terminate with a `manage-status mark-step-done` call that carries `--display-detail "{one-line summary}"`. This is REQUIRED, not optional — a missing or empty `display_detail` causes renderer failure in Step 5 (the literal placeholder `<missing display_detail>` will surface to the user and contribute to a `[FAILED]` headline). The detail string is authored by the step itself; the renderer NEVER invents content on the step's behalf.

The full command template (use verbatim, substituting the placeholders):

```bash
python3 .plan/execute-script.py plan-marshall:manage-status:manage_status mark-step-done \
  --plan-id {plan_id} --phase 6-finalize --step {step_name} --outcome {done|skipped|failed} \
  --display-detail "{one-line summary}"
```

MANDATORY annotations for every argument:

- `--phase` — MANDATORY. Always the literal string `6-finalize` for steps dispatched under this operation. This anchors the step record to the finalize phase; any other value routes the record into the wrong phase bucket and breaks the Step 5 renderer grouping.
- `--outcome` — MANDATORY. Must be exactly one of `done`, `skipped`, or `failed`. Any other value (including misspellings or capitalized variants) is rejected by `manage_status`. The choice determines the headline classification and CANNOT be inferred from `display_detail` alone.
- `--step` — MANDATORY. Must match the fully-qualified step name as listed in `marshal.json` (e.g. `default:commit-push`, `project:foo`, or `plan-marshall:some-skill:some-script`). Mismatches here create orphan status records that the renderer cannot pair with the dispatched step.
- `--display-detail` — MANDATORY. Single-line summary of what the step actually did, authored by the step itself. Subject to the constraints listed below. A missing, empty, or whitespace-only value triggers the `<missing display_detail>` placeholder and contributes a `[FAILED]` headline regardless of the `--outcome` value.

**Notation:** the third segment is `manage_status` (with an UNDERSCORE). The hyphenated form `manage-status` is the subcommand name, not the script name. Using `plan-marshall:manage-status:manage-status` triggers an executor lookup failure.

**`display_detail` constraints:**

- ≤80 characters
- No trailing period
- No embedded newlines (single line only)
- Plain ASCII — no unicode glyphs
- Concrete and user-facing (describe what the step did, not how)

See [standards/output-template.md](standards/output-template.md#display_detail-contract-for-step-authors) for the full detail-string convention, ASCII icon rules, and concrete examples per built-in step.

## Operation: finalize

**Input**: `plan_id`

### Step 0: Resolve Worktree and Main Checkout Paths

**This step runs before any other finalize step** and makes `{worktree_path}` and `{main_checkout}` available to every subsequent step and standards document. All git Bash calls and all build/CI/sonar/github/gitlab script invocations in the finalize workflow depend on these two values — no standards document may resolve them independently.

Read the plan status and extract the worktree path from metadata:

```bash
python3 .plan/execute-script.py plan-marshall:manage-status:manage_status read \
  --plan-id {plan_id}
```

Extract `metadata.worktree_path`:

- **If present**: the plan ran in an isolated worktree. Capture the value as `{worktree_path}`. The main checkout is the parent of `.claude/worktrees/{plan_id}/` — derive `{main_checkout}` by stripping the trailing `/.claude/worktrees/{plan_id}` segment from `{worktree_path}`, or resolve it explicitly:

```bash
git -C {worktree_path} rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir
```

The `git-common-dir` output ends with `/.git` inside the main checkout — `{main_checkout}` is its parent directory.

- **If absent** (pre-worktree plan or `use_worktree == false`): there is no worktree. Set `{worktree_path}` equal to `{main_checkout}`, where `{main_checkout}` is the repository root resolved via:

```bash
git rev-parse --show-toplevel
```

Log the resolved paths so they remain visible in model context for every subsequent Edit/Write/Read/Bash call:

```bash
python3 .plan/execute-script.py plan-marshall:manage-logging:manage-logging \
  work --plan-id {plan_id} --level INFO --message "[STATUS] (plan-marshall:phase-6-finalize) Finalize cwd context: worktree_path={worktree_path} main_checkout={main_checkout} — all git calls MUST use 'git -C' with one of these paths, all script calls MUST pass '--project-dir'"
```

From this point on, every standards document loaded by the finalize pipeline inherits `{worktree_path}` and `{main_checkout}` from this step. Standards documents MUST NOT re-resolve these values.

### Step 1: Check Q-Gate Findings and Log Start

#### Log Phase Start

```bash
python3 .plan/execute-script.py plan-marshall:manage-logging:manage-logging \
  work --plan-id {plan_id} --level INFO --message "[STATUS] (plan-marshall:phase-6-finalize) Starting finalize phase"
```

#### Query Unresolved Findings

```bash
python3 .plan/execute-script.py plan-marshall:manage-findings:manage-findings \
  qgate query --plan-id {plan_id} --phase 6-finalize --resolution pending
```

If unresolved findings exist from a previous iteration (filtered_count > 0):

For each pending finding:
1. Check if it was addressed by the fix tasks that just ran
2. Resolve:
```bash
python3 .plan/execute-script.py plan-marshall:manage-findings:manage-findings \
  qgate resolve --plan-id {plan_id} --hash-id {hash_id} --resolution fixed --phase 6-finalize \
  --detail "{fix task reference or description}"
```
3. Log:
```bash
python3 .plan/execute-script.py plan-marshall:manage-logging:manage-logging \
  decision --plan-id {plan_id} --level INFO --message "(plan-marshall:phase-6-finalize:qgate) Finding {hash_id} [qgate]: fixed — {resolution_detail}"
```

### Step 2: Read Manifest and Cross-Phase Configuration

The phase-6-finalize step list is read from the **per-plan execution manifest** (`execution.toon`), not from `marshal.json`. The manifest is composed at outline time by `plan-marshall:manage-execution-manifest:compose` and is the single source of truth for which Phase 6 steps fire for this plan. This skill reads the manifest verbatim and dispatches — it carries NO per-step skip logic of its own.

#### Read the execution manifest

```bash
python3 .plan/execute-script.py plan-marshall:manage-execution-manifest:manage-execution-manifest \
  read --plan-id {plan_id}
```

Extract `phase_6.steps` — the ordered list of step IDs (e.g., `commit-push`, `create-pr`, `automated-review`, …) to execute. Step IDs in the manifest are **bare names** (no `default:` prefix). The dispatcher in Step 3 prepends `default:` when looking up built-in steps, but otherwise iterates the list verbatim.

**If the manifest is missing** (`status: error, error: file_not_found`): abort finalize with an explicit error — the manifest is REQUIRED. Re-run `plan-marshall:manage-execution-manifest:compose` from outline phase to repair.

#### Read cross-phase configuration

```bash
python3 .plan/execute-script.py plan-marshall:manage-config:manage-config \
  plan phase-6-finalize get --trace-plan-id {plan_id}
```

```bash
python3 .plan/execute-script.py plan-marshall:manage-config:manage-config \
  plan phase-5-execute get --trace-plan-id {plan_id}
```

```bash
python3 .plan/execute-script.py plan-marshall:manage-config:manage-config \
  plan phase-1-init get --trace-plan-id {plan_id}
```

Read the config blocks for `review_bot_buffer_seconds`, `max_iterations`, `commit_strategy`, and `branch_strategy`. **Do not** read the `steps` field from `marshal.json` here — that field is the candidate set consumed by `phase-4-plan` Step 8b, not by this skill. The manifest's `phase_6.steps` list is the only valid source for runtime dispatch.

Also read references context for branch and issue information:

```bash
python3 .plan/execute-script.py plan-marshall:manage-references:manage-references get-context \
  --plan-id {plan_id}
```

**After reading configuration**, log the finalize strategy decision:

```bash
python3 .plan/execute-script.py plan-marshall:manage-logging:manage-logging \
  decision --plan-id {plan_id} --level INFO --message "(plan-marshall:phase-6-finalize) Finalize strategy: commit={commit_strategy}, manifest_steps={steps_count}, branch={branch_strategy}"
```

### Step 3: Execute Step Pipeline (Manifest-Driven, Resumable, Timeout-Wrapped)

Iterate over `manifest.phase_6.steps` (read in Step 2). The list is the manifest's authoritative ordering — neither this skill nor any standards document re-orders, filters, or skip-conditional any step.

**Resumable re-entry semantics**: Before dispatching each step, read the current step record from `status.metadata.phase_steps["6-finalize"]`. If the step is already marked `done`, skip dispatch entirely (no re-run, no log noise — the previous run completed it). If the step is marked `failed`, retry it from scratch. If the step has no record (or any other outcome), dispatch it as a fresh run. This makes finalize safe to re-enter after a partial run, a crash, or an explicit retry — completed steps stay completed, failed steps get exactly one retry per invocation.

**Per-agent timeout wrapper**: Every Task agent dispatch in this loop runs under a per-agent timeout budget. If the dispatch does not return inside the budget, the wrapper logs an ERROR, marks the step `failed` via `manage-status mark-step-done`, and continues with the next step in the list (no abort, no re-throw). Inline-only steps are not timeout-wrapped because they execute in the main context where Claude Code already manages call timeouts. Budgets:

| Step | Budget | Rationale |
|------|--------|-----------|
| `default:sonar-roundtrip` | 15 min (900s) | Full Sonar gate roundtrip plus optional fix-task creation |
| `default:automated-review` | 15 min (900s) | CI wait + review-bot buffer + comment triage |
| `default:knowledge-capture` | 5 min (300s) | Bounded `manage-memories save` workflow |
| `default:lessons-capture` | 5 min (300s) | Bounded `manage-lessons add` + Write workflow |
| All other steps | no explicit budget | Fall under Claude Code's default per-call ceiling |

For each step reference:

**Agent-suitable built-in steps** (self-contained, no user interaction) — each dispatches to a named, enforcement-bearing agent (NOT a generic Task agent):

| Step reference | Dispatch target (agent) |
|----------------|-------------------------|
| `default:create-pr` | `plan-marshall:create-pr-agent` |
| `default:automated-review` | `plan-marshall:automated-review-agent` |
| `default:sonar-roundtrip` | `plan-marshall:sonar-roundtrip-agent` |
| `default:knowledge-capture` | `plan-marshall:knowledge-capture-agent` |
| `default:lessons-capture` | `plan-marshall:lessons-capture-agent` |

**Inline-only built-in steps** (require user interaction or sequential dependency):
- `commit-push` (git working directory state), `branch-cleanup` (AskUserQuestion), `review-knowledge` (AskUserQuestion batch gate — classification sub-calls dispatch to `plan-marshall:classify-knowledge-agent`, see `standards/review-knowledge.md` §3f), `record-metrics` (must run immediately before `archive-plan` on the still-live plan directory), `archive-plan` (must be last, moves plan files)

Before entering the loop, initialise a running token tally in model context:

```
agent_usage_totals = {total_tokens: 0, tool_uses: 0, duration_ms: 0}
```

`default:record-metrics` reads this accumulator at `end-phase` time.

```
FOR each step_id in manifest.phase_6.steps:
  step_ref = "default:" + step_id   # manifest holds bare names; dispatcher prepends prefix

  1. Resumable re-entry check:
     Read status.metadata.phase_steps["6-finalize"][step_id]:
       - IF outcome == "done": SKIP this step (continue to next iteration)
       - IF outcome == "failed": RETRY (proceed to dispatch as fresh run)
       - IF no record OR any other value: dispatch normally
     Log skip/retry decisions at INFO level so the work.log reflects the re-entry path.

  2. Log step start:
     python3 .plan/execute-script.py plan-marshall:manage-logging:manage-logging \
       work --plan-id {plan_id} --level INFO --message "[STEP] (plan-marshall:phase-6-finalize) Executing step: {step_ref}"

  3. Determine step type:
     - IF step_ref starts with "default:" -> BUILT-IN type (use step_id for dispatch table lookup)
     - ELSE IF step_ref starts with "project:" -> PROJECT type (manifest may someday include extension steps)
     - ELSE IF step_ref contains ":" -> SKILL type

  4. Pre-archive snapshot hook (run BEFORE dispatching the step if step_id == "archive-plan"):
     See "Pre-Archive Snapshot Hook" subsection below. Capture the snapshot into model context, then proceed to step 5 to dispatch archive-plan normally.

  5. Dispatch with timeout wrapper:
     Resolve the per-agent timeout budget from the table above (15 min for sonar/automated-review, 5 min for knowledge/lessons; no explicit budget for other steps).

     - BUILT-IN (agent-suitable) — route each step_ref to its named agent via the Task tool, wrapped with the resolved timeout. Dispatch MUST name the specific agent below so the step's enforcement envelope (input contract, required skill loads, prohibited actions) is carried into the subagent context; a generic unscoped agent selection is NOT valid:
         * default:create-pr        -> Task(subagent_type: plan-marshall:create-pr-agent)
         * default:automated-review -> Task(subagent_type: plan-marshall:automated-review-agent, timeout: 900s)
         * default:sonar-roundtrip  -> Task(subagent_type: plan-marshall:sonar-roundtrip-agent, timeout: 900s)
         * default:knowledge-capture -> Task(subagent_type: plan-marshall:knowledge-capture-agent, timeout: 300s)
         * default:lessons-capture  -> Task(subagent_type: plan-marshall:lessons-capture-agent, timeout: 300s)
       Each agent reads its corresponding standards document (standards/{name}.md) and executes all steps within the agent context. Pass `--plan-id {plan_id}` and, when an `{iteration}` counter applies, `--iteration {iteration}`. Embed the Worktree Header from `plan-marshall:phase-5-execute` Dispatch Protocol in every agent prompt so the worktree constraint propagates.

       **On timeout** (the dispatch does not return within the budget):
         a. Log ERROR:
            python3 .plan/execute-script.py plan-marshall:manage-logging:manage-logging \
              work --plan-id {plan_id} --level ERROR --message "[ERROR] (plan-marshall:phase-6-finalize) Step {step_ref} timed out after {budget}s — marking failed and continuing"
         b. Mark step failed:
            python3 .plan/execute-script.py plan-marshall:manage-status:manage_status mark-step-done \
              --plan-id {plan_id} --phase 6-finalize --step {step_id} --outcome failed \
              --display-detail "timed out after {budget}s"
         c. Continue to the next step in the loop — DO NOT abort the pipeline.

     - BUILT-IN (inline-only: commit-push, branch-cleanup, review-knowledge, record-metrics, archive-plan):
       Read the standards document from dispatch table and follow all steps in main context. Inline steps are not timeout-wrapped — they execute under Claude Code's standard per-call ceiling. For `review-knowledge` §3f classification sub-dispatches, route each candidate through `plan-marshall:classify-knowledge-agent` — see `standards/review-knowledge.md` for the prompt body.

     - PROJECT/SKILL: Load the skill with interface contract:
       Skill: {step_ref}
         Arguments: --plan-id {plan_id} --iteration {iteration} [--session-id {session_id}]

       Append `--session-id {session_id}` ONLY when `step_ref` is on the
       Session-id forwarding whitelist documented under "Interface Contract
       for External Steps" above (the table at that section is the single
       source of truth — do not re-list its entries here). Off-whitelist
       external steps receive `--plan-id` and `--iteration` only —
       appending `--session-id` to a step that does not declare it risks a
       "rejected unknown flag" failure.

  5b. Accumulate agent usage (only when the dispatched step ran as a Task agent and did NOT time out):
      Extract total_tokens, tool_uses, duration_ms from the agent's <usage> tag and add them to agent_usage_totals. Inline steps and timed-out steps contribute nothing — the timeout path's cost is captured by the `manage-metrics enrich` transcript sweep inside `default:record-metrics`.

  6. Capture archive result (only when step_id == "archive-plan"):
     Record the returned `archive_path` into model context alongside the pre-archive snapshot — it is consumed by Step 5 (Render Final Output Template).

  7. Log step completion:
     python3 .plan/execute-script.py plan-marshall:manage-logging:manage-logging \
       work --plan-id {plan_id} --level INFO --message "[STEP] (plan-marshall:phase-6-finalize) Completed step: {step_ref}"
END FOR
```

**Critical invariant**: This loop iterates **only** the manifest list. A step that is NOT in `manifest.phase_6.steps` MUST NOT fire under any circumstance — there is no fallback to a "default" step set, no inference from config booleans, no per-step skip logic. The manifest is the contract. If a deployment requires a different step set, recompose the manifest at outline time.

**Lessons-capture unconditionality**: When `lessons-capture` IS in `manifest.phase_6.steps` (the composer includes it for every non-trivial change-type), this loop dispatches it on every Phase 6 entry. It is not gated on PR state, CI state, or earlier step outcomes — reaching Phase 6 is itself the trigger.

#### Pre-Archive Snapshot Hook

When the NEXT step to dispatch is `default:archive-plan` (always the last CONFIGURED step), capture a snapshot of plan state BEFORE dispatching archive-plan. The archive step moves `.plan/plans/{plan_id}/` to `.plan/archived-plans/{date}-{plan_id}/` and invalidates subsequent `manage-status read` calls against the live path, so the renderer (Step 5) would be unable to read state after archive returns.

The snapshot is held in **model context (in-memory)** — do NOT write a work file to disk. It flows directly from this hook into Step 5's render procedure.

Capture the following values:

1. **`status.metadata.phase_steps["6-finalize"]`** — dict of `{step_name: {outcome, display_detail}}` from `manage-status read --plan-id {plan_id}`.
2. **Deliverables list** — from `manage-solution-outline read --plan-id {plan_id}` (ordered list of titles and per-deliverable state).
3. **Manifest `phase_6.steps` list** — from `manage-execution-manifest read --plan-id {plan_id}` (already fetched in Step 2; capture the bare-name list for renderer ordering).
4. **Repository state** — branch via `git -C {main_checkout} branch --show-current`, porcelain via `git -C {main_checkout} status --porcelain`.
5. **PR state + number** — via `ci pr view --project-dir {main_checkout}`. Treat error (no PR for branch) as `state=n/a, number=n/a`.
6. **Solution outline Summary** — the 2-3 sentence Summary body that feeds the Goal block. Fetch via `manage-solution-outline read --plan-id {plan_id} --section summary` and extract the `content` field. On `section_not_found` or empty content, store the sentinel value `None`; the emission procedure substitutes the defensive placeholder `(no summary recorded)`.
7. **Plan `short_description`** — the compact label used by Step 7's terminal `done` emission. Extract `plan.short_description` from `manage-status read --plan-id {plan_id}` (already fetched in item 1). Store the raw string, or `None` when the field is absent/empty. This value is captured **before** archive so it remains available after `status.json` is moved.

See [standards/output-template.md#snapshot-procedure](standards/output-template.md#snapshot-procedure) for exact commands and field extraction.

After the snapshot is captured, dispatch `default:archive-plan` normally (step 4 in the FOR body above) and capture its returned `archive_path` (step 5). Both the snapshot and `archive_path` flow into Step 5 "Render Final Output Template".

**Built-in step notes**:
- `default:branch-cleanup`: Do NOT preemptively skip based on PR state. The `standards/branch-cleanup.md` standard has its own `AskUserQuestion` confirmation gate.
- `default:record-metrics`: MUST immediately precede `default:archive-plan`. This step finalizes the `6-finalize` phase with two `manage-metrics` writes (`end-phase` for the closing phase + `generate` for `metrics.md`) and a separate `enrich` for session token capture. Plan finalization has no "next phase" so the fused `phase-boundary` subcommand does not apply here — see `standards/record-metrics.md` for the authoritative sequence. All writes MUST land on the live plan directory; if archive runs first, the target directory no longer exists and each command would recreate a post-archive orphan under `.plan/local/plans/{plan_id}/`.
- `default:archive-plan`: This step MUST be last in the default order because it moves plan files (including status.json), which breaks manage-* scripts. All plan operations must complete before archive.

Do NOT add any further `manage-metrics` invocations after `default:archive-plan` or after `Skill: plan-marshall:phase-6-finalize` returns to its caller. The plan-finalization bookkeeping (`end-phase` + `enrich` + `generate`) is fully contained by `default:record-metrics`.

### Step 4: Mark Plan Complete

```bash
python3 .plan/execute-script.py plan-marshall:manage-status:manage_status transition \
  --plan-id {plan_id} \
  --completed 6-finalize
```

### Step 5: Render Final Output Template

**This step ALWAYS runs** — it is NOT configurable via the `steps` list. It is the terminal action of the phase, invoked after `default:archive-plan` returns in Step 3.

Load the renderer specification:

```
Skill: plan-marshall:phase-6-finalize
  Standards: standards/output-template.md
```

**Inputs** (both already in model context from Step 3):

- **Pre-archive snapshot** — captured by the Pre-Archive Snapshot Hook before `default:archive-plan` dispatched. Contains `phase_steps` map, deliverables list, configured `steps` list, repository branch/porcelain, PR state/number, and the solution outline Summary text captured via `manage-solution-outline read --section summary`.
- **`archive_path`** — returned by `default:archive-plan` in Step 3.

**Procedure:** Follow the emission procedure in [standards/output-template.md#emission-procedure](standards/output-template.md#emission-procedure). The renderer is a pure assembler:

1. Resolve the headline token (`MERGED` / `OPEN` / `LOOP_BACK` / `SKIPPED` / `FAILED`) via the precedence chain.
2. Build the headline.
3. Build the Goal block (literal `Goal` header, blank line, Summary text wrapped to ~78 chars with 2-space indent; defensive `(no summary recorded)` fallback when Summary is `None` or empty).
4. Build the Deliverables block (one row per deliverable, icon by outcome).
5. Build the Finalize steps block (one row per configured step, padded 33-char name + `display_detail`).
6. Build the Repository trailer (main state | worktree token | working tree state).
7. Emit the five blocks separated by blank lines as a plain-text, user-facing output.

**No additional script calls are needed for this step** — the renderer consumes only the in-memory snapshot plus `archive_path`. It performs no `manage-status` / `manage-solution-outline` / `ci pr view` reads of its own.

The emitted template is a **user-facing text block printed to the model's output**, not a log entry. It is the primary surface reported to the user at the end of the finalize phase.

### Step 6: Log Phase Completion

Final metrics are already recorded inside the Step 3 pipeline by `default:record-metrics` (which runs immediately before `default:archive-plan`). This step only logs phase completion to work.log.

```bash
python3 .plan/execute-script.py plan-marshall:manage-logging:manage-logging \
  work --plan-id {plan_id} --level INFO --message "[STATUS] (plan-marshall:phase-6-finalize) Plan completed: {steps_count} steps executed"
```

```bash
python3 .plan/execute-script.py plan-marshall:manage-logging:manage-logging \
  separator --plan-id {plan_id} --type work
```

**Note**: `manage-logging` operates on log files, not the plan directory, so these calls remain valid after `default:archive-plan` has moved the plan state.

### Step 7: Emit Done Terminal Title

**This step ALWAYS runs** when a `short_description` was captured in the pre-archive snapshot — it is NOT configurable via the `steps` list.

Emit a one-shot `✓ pm:done:{short_description}` OSC escape to the terminal so the session tab reflects plan completion. The emission is stateless: the OSC write sticks until the next Claude Code hook fires (`UserPromptSubmit` → running, `Stop` → idle, `SessionStart` → idle), at which point the next hook overwrites it. No session state file, clearing hook, or TTL is required.

**Why this runs AFTER `default:archive-plan`**: archive has already moved the live plan directory, so the normal cwd/status.json resolution chain would return `◯ claude`. The `--plan-label` argument bypasses that chain by accepting the label directly from the caller. The label value comes from item 7 of the pre-archive snapshot, captured while `status.json` was still live.

**If `short_description` is `None` or empty**: skip this step (log at INFO and continue to return). A plan created before the `short_description` field existed, or one whose derivation produced an empty string, cannot produce a meaningful `pm:done:` label; in that case the title stays at whatever the last hook emitted (typically `◯ claude` via Stop).

**If `short_description` is set**: invoke the terminal-title script from the plugin cache, passing the captured label. The script is user-invoked from hooks via absolute path — use the same absolute path that the Terminal Title Integration config resolved at `/marshall-steward` time, typically:

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/plugins/cache/plan-marshall/marketplace/bundles/plan-marshall/skills/plan-marshall/scripts/set_terminal_title.py done --plan-label "{short_description}"
```

**Advisory**: this step is best-effort. On any error (script missing, non-zero exit, `/dev/tty` unavailable), log a WARN and continue. A missing terminal emission is cosmetic and MUST NOT block finalize from returning success — the plan has already archived, all state transitions are committed, and the user can still read the Step 5 output template in their scrollback:

```bash
python3 .plan/execute-script.py plan-marshall:manage-logging:manage-logging \
  work --plan-id {plan_id} --level WARN --message "[WARN] (plan-marshall:phase-6-finalize) Terminal done-title emission failed: {error}"
```

## Output

**Success** (user-facing):

The primary output is the five-block template rendered by Step 5. It is a plain-text, user-facing block — not TOON — assembled from the pre-archive snapshot plus `archive_path`. See [standards/output-template.md](standards/output-template.md) for the full renderer specification.

## Error Handling

On any error, **first log the error** to work-log:

```bash
python3 .plan/execute-script.py plan-marshall:manage-logging:manage-logging \
  work --plan-id {plan_id} --level ERROR --message "[ERROR] (plan-marshall:phase-6-finalize) {step} failed - {error_type}: {error_context}"
```

See `standards/validation.md` for specific error scenarios and recovery actions.

---

## Resumability

Step activation is determined by presence in `manifest.phase_6.steps` — absent steps are NEVER executed under any circumstance.

The Step 3 dispatch loop is fully resumable across re-entries: each step's `status.metadata.phase_steps["6-finalize"][step_id].outcome` drives the per-step decision on a fresh phase-6 invocation:

| Outcome on re-entry | Action |
|---------------------|--------|
| `done` | Skip dispatch entirely. The step ran successfully on a previous invocation; do not re-execute. |
| `failed` | Retry from scratch. The previous run produced a `failed` record (typically a timeout or step-internal abort); the new invocation gets exactly one fresh attempt. |
| (no record) | Dispatch as a first-time run. |
| any other value | Dispatch as a first-time run (treat as a degraded record). |

This makes finalize safe to interrupt and re-enter — completed work is preserved, failed work gets a retry, never-run work runs for the first time. There is no separate "resume" mode; every Phase 6 entry is implicitly resumable.

In-step state checks (consulted by individual standards docs after dispatch — these guard idempotent operations, not skip activation):

1. **Uncommitted changes?** `git status --porcelain` — empty → `commit-push` records "no changes" and marks done.
2. **PR exists?** `ci pr view` — `status: success` → `create-pr` re-uses the existing PR.
3. **Plan complete?** `manage-status read` — `current_phase: complete` → finalize has nothing to do; return immediately.

### Phase-boundary metric bookkeeping

Phase finalization has no "next phase" — it closes the plan. The fused
`manage-metrics phase-boundary` subcommand therefore does NOT apply at this
boundary. The closing sequence (`end-phase 6-finalize` → `enrich` →
`generate`) lives in `standards/record-metrics.md` and remains a three-call
sequence by design. The fused `phase-boundary` call is only used at
inter-phase transitions (`1-init → 2-refine` … `5-execute → 6-finalize`),
recorded by the orchestrator workflows.
