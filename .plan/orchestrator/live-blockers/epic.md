## Vision

plan-marshall's workflow machinery is being rewritten as plan-marshall-mcp, and until that ships
plan-marshall stays in daily production use. This epic holds the work that cannot wait for the
rewrite: defects that make a normal plan run fail, mislead or need an operator override today,
and high-priority work on things the rewrite does not replace — harness sync, organisation CI,
the review bots and their rollout. It is too large for one plan because the 21 fixes sit on
different surfaces and most are independently shippable. The epic is done when a plan can run
from init to merge in this repository and in a consumer repository without a manual override,
and the review gate can be trusted to mean what it says.

The epic was cut on 2026-10-07 from a sweep of the nine epics active at the time and the lessons
store. Eight of those epics were closed and archived in the same act; `lessons-routing` stays
active. Design input for the rewrite is not carried here: it lives in plan-marshall-mcp's
requirements, specification and implementation-watch documents.

## Queue annotations

The queue was regrouped on 2026-10-08 (see Decisions). Eleven plans are live: PLAN-LB-14 and
PLAN-LB-22 to PLAN-LB-31. PLAN-LB-01 to PLAN-LB-13 and PLAN-LB-15 to PLAN-LB-21 are
`superseded`; their spec files stay as the record of the first cut.

- **Where each earlier plan went.**
  - PLAN-LB-22 finalize-loop-control — PLAN-LB-10, PLAN-LB-02, PLAN-LB-05 D5.
  - PLAN-LB-23 verify-builds — PLAN-LB-12, PLAN-LB-01.
  - PLAN-LB-24 review-step — PLAN-LB-05 D3, PLAN-LB-18, PLAN-LB-19.
  - PLAN-LB-25 phase-and-merge-gates — PLAN-LB-09, PLAN-LB-05 D1 and D2, PLAN-LB-04.
  - PLAN-LB-26 execute-loop-triage — PLAN-LB-06, PLAN-LB-05 D4, PLAN-LB-08.
  - PLAN-LB-27 plan-footprint — PLAN-LB-07, PLAN-LB-11.
  - PLAN-LB-28 java-consumer-repos — PLAN-LB-13, PLAN-LB-03 (labelled a weak merge in its header).
  - PLAN-LB-29 harness-sync — PLAN-LB-15, PLAN-LB-17.
  - PLAN-LB-30 org-ci-release — PLAN-LB-16, PLAN-LB-20 D1 to D3.
  - PLAN-LB-31 in-house-reviewer — PLAN-LB-21, PLAN-LB-20 D4 and D5.
  - PLAN-LB-14 launch-gate-scope — unchanged.
- **Which plans may run together.** Measured with `corpus cross-check` after the regrouping:
  40 of the 55 pairs of live plans share no declared file. The fifteen pairs that do:
  - PLAN-LB-22 with each of 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 and 28. It is the hub of the finalize work
    (`phase-6-finalize/SKILL.md`, `manage-status`, `execution.md`,
    `pre-submission-self-review.md`, and directory-level entries under `phase-6-finalize/`).
  - PLAN-LB-24 with 25, 26 and 27 (`phase-6-finalize/SKILL.md`, `merge_lock.py`, `triage.md`).
  - PLAN-LB-26 with 23, 27 and 28 (`manage-tasks/SKILL.md`, `phase-5-execute/SKILL.md`,
    `execution.md`, `pre-submission-self-review.md`).
  - PLAN-LB-25 with 27 (`phase-6-finalize/SKILL.md`).
  - PLAN-LB-23 with 28 (`_build_shared.py`, which 28 touches only conditionally).
  - PLAN-LB-14 with 29 (`orchestrator.py`, `plan-orchestrator/SKILL.md`).
- **Queue order** is built for pairs: PLAN-LB-14 with 22; then 23 with 24; then 25 with 26;
  then 27 with 28. PLAN-LB-29, 30 and 31 share no file with any of 22 to 28 and fill a slot
  whenever one is free; 29 waits for PLAN-LB-14. At a parallelization scope above 2, up to five
  plans are mutually disjoint at once (for example 23, 24, 29, 30 and 31).
- **Emitted on 2026-10-08, two blocks.** PLAN-LB-14 and PLAN-LB-22 were emitted first, under
  operator override of the launch gate. For a second machine, PLAN-LB-30 and PLAN-LB-31 were
  identified as the two further plans that can run beside them: each shares no declared file
  with PLAN-LB-14, with PLAN-LB-22, or with the other (measured with `corpus cross-check`),
  and they are the only two live plans for which that holds — PLAN-LB-23 to 28 each overlap
  PLAN-LB-22, and PLAN-LB-29 overlaps PLAN-LB-14. Four plans in flight is above the
  parallelization scope of 2; that is the operator's instruction, and the knob was left as it
  is. One order remains between the two: PLAN-LB-31 starts with its measurement and stops
  after the recorded roster decision until PLAN-LB-30 has released the schema. All four rows
  stay `staged` until the operator confirms each launch.
- **Order swapped on 2026-10-08: PLAN-LB-29 before PLAN-LB-14.** PLAN-LB-30 was started on a
  second machine on the Antigravity harness, whose installs are missing every skill
  `workflow/` file until PLAN-LB-29 lands. The operator had PLAN-LB-29 emitted at once for
  that reason. The two plans share `plan-orchestrator/scripts/orchestrator.py` and
  `plan-orchestrator/SKILL.md`, so PLAN-LB-14, emitted earlier but not launched, now waits for
  PLAN-LB-29 and is not launched beside it. `next` keeps refusing for that much longer.
- **PLAN-LB-14 shipped on 2026-10-08 (#1715, `3fe828c84`)** — record at `landings/PLAN-LB-14.md`.
  It ran and landed while PLAN-LB-29 was running, although the ledger held it until 29 had
  landed. Nothing collided at its merge; PLAN-LB-29 now rebases onto it in
  `plan-orchestrator/scripts/orchestrator.py` and `plan-orchestrator/SKILL.md`. The gate it
  ships judges each candidate against in-flight work only, and puts an overlap of more than
  one shared entry to the operator instead of refusing.
- **Inbox drain of 2026-10-08, six messages** (five from PLAN-LB-14, one from PLAN-LB-22):
  - `lb-14-launch-gate-scope-005.md` (landing) — reconciled; complete.
  - `lb-14-launch-gate-scope-001.md` — folded into PLAN-LB-22 as a recurrence, recorded here
    and not in the spec because that plan is in flight: on this epic's first landing
    `finalize-step-lessons-housekeeping` and `finalize-step-plugin-doctor` each fired five
    times with identical verdicts. PLAN-LB-22 already carries the `verdict_inputs` declaration
    for lessons-housekeeping (PLAN-LB-02 D5). It leaves plugin-doctor's recorded refusal to
    declare standing; the message proposes declaring the scoped skill directories for it,
    which that plan's outline should weigh against the refusal's evidence. No surface added.
  - `lb-14-launch-gate-scope-002.md` — promoted to the lessons corpus as `2026-10-08-15-001`:
    a rule corrected at many sites needs one canonical statement and pointers elsewhere. It
    applies to every plan here that makes several documents state one rule (22, 24, 25, 26).
  - `lb-14-launch-gate-scope-003.md` — promoted as `2026-10-08-15-002`: the retrospective's
    outline-vs-shipped aspect counts a superseded exclusion as violated. No owner in this epic.
  - `lb-14-launch-gate-scope-004.md` — folded into PLAN-LB-23 as a hypothesis and a
    verify-first clause on PLAN-LB-12 D5: routed builds left no change-ledger row for the
    plan. Expected surface unchanged; `_build_shared.py` was already declared.
  - `lb-22-finalize-loop-control-001.md` (finding) — absorbed as an Open Defect, below.
- PLAN-LB-22 — running; the operator confirmed the start on 2026-10-08.
- **Standalone plan outside the queue, commissioned by the operator on 2026-10-08:** "the
  pre-submission self-review blocks on real defects, not on wording". It has no queue row and
  is not run through plan-marshall; the operator hands it to OpenCode. Brief:
  `doc/plans/live-blockers/self-review-materiality/plan.md` in the worktree
  `.plan/local/worktrees/self-review-materiality` (branch `fix/self-review-materiality`, cut
  from `3fe828c84`; the brief is untracked and is not to be committed). It adds a severity
  rubric, lets only `medium` and above loop, rewrites the verifier's stop question, adds a
  behavioural check over changed functions, and screens prose candidates. Basis, read from
  the archived plans: about 205 self-review findings in 40 plans, roughly a quarter real
  defects and more than half wording, every one filed at one constant severity.
  - It edits `pre-submission-self-review.md`, which PLAN-LB-22 (running) is editing, and the
    surfacer skill that PLAN-LB-28 will edit. The brief names the sections each owns and
    tells the run to rebase; whichever of it and PLAN-LB-22 merges second resolves the
    overlap. PLAN-LB-28's outline must read what this plan shipped before scoping its
    PLAN-LB-03 deliverables, and PLAN-LB-26's PLAN-LB-08 deliverables keep their one-call
    edit in that file.
- **Sequencing inside the bundles** that the earlier notes asked for is now internal:
  PLAN-LB-05 D3 before PLAN-LB-18 before PLAN-LB-19 (all in 24); PLAN-LB-21 before the
  enrolment of PLAN-LB-20 (both in 31). Two cross-plan orders remain: 31's enrolment
  deliverables need the schema 30 releases, and 29 follows PLAN-LB-14.
- PLAN-LB-14 — the launch gate this plan fixes also gates this epic's own `next`. Until it
  lands, expect `next` to refuse and each launch to need an operator override. Two things
  were added to its spec on 2026-10-08: Step 4's overlap conjunct is refused by rows against
  archived sibling specs as well, so the plan must narrow that conjunct too; and the twenty
  superseded specs of this epic now count as indeterminate own specs until terminal rows are
  excluded.
- PLAN-LB-29 — three harness plans outside this epic were in flight on 2026-10-08 with no
  captured footprint (`harness-bundles-target-rules`, `selective-bundle-installer`,
  `steward-harness-config`). Check them before launching 29.
- **Drift since the specs were drafted** (HEAD `6edefac32` to `64b573110`): `planning.md` and
  `light-lane.md` changed, which affects the PLAN-LB-04 claims carried in 25; and
  `python-verify.yml` moved to the organisation's v0.37.0, which makes the pin claim carried
  in 30 stale. Both specs carry a verify-first clause saying so.
- **Re-grounded on 2026-10-08 at `726ca857a`** (`cleanup`). The eleven live specs carry a
  verdict on 281 claims: 259 corroborated, 13 unverifiable from this machine, 9 contradicted
  and re-scoped in place. No verdict blocks. The 151 remaining bullets are hypotheses that
  need a run or a decision, and verify-first clauses; they stay open for the launched plan.
  - The PLAN-LB-04 claims carried in 25 hold at HEAD: the light lane still has no `pr_title`
    producer.
  - The nine re-scoped claims: 22 (the simplify step reads the whole footprint, so "code
    files only" is not an admissible `verdict_inputs` declaration); 27 (a sixth staging site,
    the `land` script's path-bound `git add`); 30 (two claims: the pin is now v0.37.0, which
    still has no extra-buildable input); 31 (all seven repositories were enrolled on
    2026-10-06, six were never observed); 29 (four claims, see next bullet).
  - PLAN-LB-29 — the live state its evidence described has changed: the registry was
    repinned by hand to `0.1.1865` and is ahead of the executor (`0.1.1864`), and the cache
    manifest reads `0.1.1859`. The defect itself is confirmed in source (the sync never
    touches the registry), but it is not observable live today, and the executor now embeds
    source-tree paths. The plan must prove its parity verdicts on fixtures, cover a registry
    that is ahead, and read the executor version from `MARSHALL_VERSION`.
  - Unverifiable here: the dated store measurements in PLAN-LB-14, lessons
    `2026-10-07-07-007` and `-008` (absent from the lessons store), the `cuioss-review-bot`
    checkout (not on this machine), and three machine-local files.
- **Foreign checkout paths.** The specs carried into 28, 30 and 31 name sibling repositories
  as `/Users/oliver/git/...`. Each of those specs carries a clause to resolve the names under
  the checkout root of the machine the plan runs on.
- **Operator decisions the specs leave open** (each is a verify-first clause in its spec):
  - PLAN-LB-14 — whether a sibling spec that is only `staged` or `parked` can block a launch.
  - PLAN-LB-22 — how a plan already in finalize is read once the loop counter is per source.
  - PLAN-LB-24 — whether Sourcery may lose its credit when its review is not of the merge commit.
  - PLAN-LB-25 — write the PR title before the refine boundary, or defer the check to outline.
  - PLAN-LB-26 — sticky resolutions with an opt-in reopen of `fixed`, or always reopen `fixed`.
  - PLAN-LB-27 — how legitimate out-of-footprint edits by finalize steps get in.
  - PLAN-LB-28 — what replaces `test -pl X -am` for modules using a sibling test-jar; and
    "done, not covered" with a warning, or halt and ask.
  - PLAN-LB-29 — whether the sync may write Claude Code's plugin registry.
  - PLAN-LB-30 — what to do if the organisation workflow release is not available; the two
    `project.yml` schema decisions; cutting the organisation release.
  - PLAN-LB-31 — running `gh`-based corpus scripts, posting `/review` on merged PRs, the
    roster decision itself, and whether to enrol after it.

## Decisions

- 2026-10-07 — **Epic created by operator instruction** ("create an orchestrator for the
  critical / high; remove them from the current orchestrator; archive / dormant the other
  orchestrators beside lessons-routing"). Scope is the 21 high-priority clusters of the
  cross-epic sweep; the roughly 50 medium and low clusters are recorded in `backlog.md` and are
  not staged. Alternative considered: stage all 70 — not chosen, the operator asked for
  critical and high only.
- 2026-10-07 — **parallelization_scope set to 2** (operator choice over the project default
  of 1). Most plans share finalize files, so truly disjoint pairs will be limited; two lets a
  CI or review-bot plan run beside a finalize plan.
- 2026-10-07 — **Specs re-drafted, not copied.** Where an earlier epic already had a spec for
  the same fix, its analysis was reused but every claim was re-read against HEAD and the scope
  cut to what removes the blocker, because the source specs were up to three weeks stale and
  bundled unrelated deliverables. Each spec names the source plan ids it carries forward.
- 2026-10-07 — **Decomposed into 5 workstreams and 21 staged plans.** Spec bodies were drafted
  by five read-only agents against HEAD `6edefac32` and adjudicated here: all 21 resolve a
  declarative surface with no unresolved entry, none exceeds five deliverables, and none was
  found already fixed. Scope-bloat guard: no split needed. Two specs were amended after
  drafting — PLAN-LB-14's store figures (measured while the archived root was missing) and
  PLAN-LB-11 (the #1700 deletion as evidence).
- 2026-10-07 — **`.plan/archived-orchestrators/` restored.** PR #1700 had deleted all 2038 files
  of the archived-epic tree from `main` as a side effect of a five-file fix. Restored
  byte-identical from `78ba60f41^` in the ledger worktree before the eight closed epics were
  archived into it. Not confirmed with the operator as accidental at the time of writing.
- 2026-10-07 — **Integrated two parallel ledger landings (#1706, #1707)** that touched
  `post-run-quality` and `process-compliance` after this epic's base. The local commits were
  rebased onto them; the changed files were verified byte-identical in the archived trees, the
  two generated views were restored from the closed-state render, and both history files gained
  a "Landed in parallel with the close" section. Consequences here: `PLAN-LB-04` carries two new
  recurrences as evidence; issue #1697 is fixed (struck in `backlog.md` § 3.3).
- 2026-10-07 — **process-compliance `PLAN-17` not adopted, flagged.** That epic's session had
  emitted `PLAN-17` and `PLAN-19` under an operator "land now" override; neither was launched.
  `PLAN-19` is `PLAN-LB-06`. `PLAN-17` (clean-checkout assertions against concurrent ledger
  writes) was ranked medium in the sweep and sits in `backlog.md` § 1.15. Whether to stage it
  here is the operator's call, given the earlier land-now intent.

- 2026-10-08 — **Queue regrouped from 21 plans to 11 by operator instruction** ("make a full
  review of all plans. Rearrange that: adjacent plans (same component / topics) are bundled
  together; the plans aggregate a larger amount of deliverables (up to 12 are authorized); the
  plans are structured in a way to provide high parallelism"). Twenty specs were absorbed into
  ten new ones, PLAN-LB-22 to PLAN-LB-31, of 7 to 11 deliverables each; PLAN-LB-14 is
  unchanged. All 90 deliverables of the absorbed specs were carried, each exactly once, with
  their claim labels and surface entries copied unchanged; the move list is in Queue
  annotations. Scope-bloat guard: every new spec is above six deliverables and proceeds
  unsplit on the operator's authorization of up to twelve.
  - Two specs were cut at the deliverable level, because each spanned components that belong
    to different plans: PLAN-LB-05 (five waits in five components) and PLAN-LB-20 (schema work
    in the organisation repository, then enrolment gated on PLAN-LB-21's decision).
  - Alternatives considered and not chosen: cutting PLAN-LB-02 and PLAN-LB-09 by deliverable
    (it freed no additional pair); keeping PLAN-LB-12 with PLAN-LB-13 and PLAN-LB-05 D4 as one
    build plan (it made the build plan collide with the review plan through
    `await-long-running.md` and with the execute plan through `execution.md`).
  - No spec file was deleted. The twenty absorbed rows are `superseded`; each old spec carries
    a banner naming its successor, and its `## Expected Surface` was replaced by a `DERIVED`
    marker with the original entries kept under "Superseded Surface (record only)", so a
    retired spec no longer collides with the plan that carries its work.
  - What limits parallelism: `phase-6-finalize/SKILL.md` is edited by four of the new plans
    and `plan-marshall/workflow/execution.md` by three. Those two files, not the bundling,
    are why the finalize plans still run in sequence.
- 2026-10-08 — **Ledger worktree fast-forwarded to `main`** (`6c676de29` to `64b573110`) by
  operator instruction, after it was found three commits behind with nothing pending. Three
  leftover directories under the active root holding only an ignored `logs/decision.log`
  (`post-run-quality`, `process-compliance`, `truthful-signals`) were removed on the same
  instruction; their tracked trees are in the archived root.
- 2026-10-08 — **Cleanup run by operator instruction, then landed.** Re-grounding covered the
  eleven live specs at `726ca857a`; the twenty superseded specs were not re-grounded, because
  every claim they hold is carried, and now verdict-stamped, in a successor. Nine contradicted
  claims were re-scoped in place: the original text is kept and a dated note states what is
  true and what it changes for the plan. No spec was found already fixed, none lacks an
  objective, a surface or claim labels, and no relocation to `settled.md` was proposed (no
  subject of this epic is closed yet). The inbox drain was refused as the workflow requires.
  Restart verdict `indeterminate`, for one reason: the epic has no `inbox/` directory yet.
  - Deviation, recorded: the eleven verification agents were each allowed to write one result
    file under `.plan/temp/`, and the verdicts were stamped from those files by a driver that
    calls `corpus set-verdict` once per claim. No agent wrote to the ledger.

## Open Defects

- **Medium and low items are not owned by any staged plan.** They are listed with evidence
  in `backlog.md` (sections 1.12 onward, 2.3 onward, 3.2 onward, 4.7 onward and 5). Promote an
  item into a plan spec when it starts to hurt; re-verify it at HEAD first.
- **35 active lessons have no router of their own beyond `lessons-routing`**, which was
  dormant at the cut. The lessons that describe live defects are folded into the specs here
  and into `backlog.md`; two lessons describe defects already fixed and should be retired
  (`2026-09-27-07-001`, `2026-10-02-21-006`), and `2026-09-27-19-001` has no metadata header.
  — source: sweep of the lessons store, 2026-10-07.
- **The outline leaf has no signal for an ambiguous change type, and two documents disagree on
  the skills the detection dispatch carries.** When `change-type-heuristic` ties,
  `phase-3-outline` Step 4b prescribes a dispatch the outline leaf cannot issue; the leaf
  returns `blocked` with a free-form field and `planning-outline.md` Step 2 has no handler for
  it. PLAN-LB-22 hit this, lost one outline dispatch (about 198K tokens) and got past it with
  three moves no document prescribes. Separately, `outline-workflow-detail.md` lists one skill
  for the `detect-change-type` dispatch where the workflow's own Inputs require three. Reach:
  every deep-lane, non-recipe plan whose heuristic ties. Not owned by any staged plan; stage it
  if it recurs. — source: inbox message `lb-22-finalize-loop-control-001.md`, 2026-10-08, read
  at bundle version 0.1.1867; not verified against the source here.

## Watches

- **PLAN-LB-29 must rebase onto PLAN-LB-14's landing** in `orchestrator.py` and
  `plan-orchestrator/SKILL.md`. — trigger: when PLAN-LB-29 reaches its pre-merge rebase or
  reports a conflict; retire when it lands.
- **The archived-epic tree left `main`** (#1717, `1e556f15d`: archived plans and orchestrator
  records moved to plan-marshall-telemetry). Claims in the live specs that cite a file under
  `.plan/archived-orchestrators/` were corroborated before that move and can no longer be read
  in this repository. — trigger: when a launched plan's outline reports such a claim as
  unreadable, point it at the telemetry repository.
- **Three plans outside this epic had no captured footprint** when last read
  (`harness-bundles-target-rules`, `selective-bundle-installer`, `steward-harness-config`).
  The gate PLAN-LB-14 shipped still refuses while a live plan has neither a footprint nor an
  orchestrated source spec. — trigger: the first `next` run on the new gate; retire when it
  reports the comparison determinate.

- **Harness installs lag the source after every landing** until PLAN-LB-15 ships: the plugin
  registry pin is behind the executor. A session may run stale skill text. — trigger: before
  trusting a skill's behaviour right after a landing, compare the registry pin with
  `MARSHALL_VERSION`; retire when PLAN-LB-15 lands.
- **`plan-pr-078-review-bot-fleet-opt-in` is still listed as in progress at finalize** with a
  dead worktree pointer and its archive step never run; four consumer checkouts are still on
  its merged branch. — trigger: clean up by hand or when the worktree-pointer fix
  (`backlog.md` § 1.14) is promoted.
