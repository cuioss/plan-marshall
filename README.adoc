== Skill Script Permissions

Many skills use bundled scripts (Python/Bash) for build parsing, coverage analysis, and validation. These require a single permission in your global settings.

=== Executor Pattern

All scripts are invoked through `.plan/execute-script.py`, requiring only one permission:

[source]
----
Bash(python3 .plan/execute-script.py:*)
----

=== First-Time Setup

Run once after installing the marketplace:

[source,bash]
----
/tools-setup-project-permissions
----

This command ensures the executor permission exists in `~/.claude/settings.json`.

== Architecture

=== Bundle Structure

Each bundle is self-contained with:

----
bundle-name/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json          # Bundle manifest
├── agents/                  # Specialized task agents
│   └── *.md
├── commands/                # Slash commands
│   └── *.md
├── skills/                  # Development standards
│   └── skill-name/
│       ├── SKILL.md
│       ├── standards/
│       └── README.md
└── README.md               # Bundle documentation
----

=== Component Types

**Skills**::
Development standards and best practices loaded by AI assistants. Skills provide expert knowledge in specific domains (Java, JavaScript, testing, documentation, etc.).

**Agents**::
Specialized autonomous agents that handle focused tasks like build execution, coverage analysis, or documentation validation. Agents use specific tool permissions and follow architectural patterns.

**Commands**::
Interactive slash commands (`/command-name`) that users invoke directly. Commands orchestrate agents and workflows to accomplish complex multi-step tasks.

== Development

=== Creating Components

Use the plugin development tools:

[source,bash]
----
# Create new skill
/plugin-create-skill

# Create new agent
/plugin-create-agent

# Create new command
/plugin-create-command

# Create new bundle
/plugin-create-bundle
----

=== Quality Verification

[source,bash]
----
# Diagnose individual bundles
/plugin-diagnose-skills
/plugin-diagnose-agents
/plugin-diagnose-commands

# Diagnose complete bundle
/plugin-diagnose-bundle <bundle-name>

# Diagnose marketplace configuration
/plugin-diagnose-marketplace
----

=== Component Inventory

List all marketplace components:

[source,bash]
----
./marketplace/bundles/pm-plugin-development/skills/cui-marketplace-architecture/scripts/scan-marketplace-inventory.sh
----
