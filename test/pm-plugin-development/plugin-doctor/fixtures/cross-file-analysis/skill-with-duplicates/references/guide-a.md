# Guide A

Reference documentation for testing cross-file analysis.

## Overview

This guide provides standards for component development.

## Code Standards

All code must follow these standards:

1. Use meaningful variable names
2. Add comments for complex logic
3. Follow the single responsibility principle
4. Write unit tests for all public methods

These standards ensure code quality and maintainability.

## Naming Conventions

Use these naming conventions throughout the codebase:

- Classes: PascalCase
- Methods: camelCase
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
- Variables: camelCase

Following consistent naming improves readability.

## Documentation Requirements

All public APIs require documentation:

- Description of purpose
- Parameter descriptions
- Return value description
- Example usage

This ensures users can understand and use the API correctly.
