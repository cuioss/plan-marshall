# Bot Participation Contract

The single source of truth for **which review bots must participate**, **what their silence means**,
and **how a non-participation is classified**. The `automatic-review` step body, the producer
(`github_pr fetch_findings`), and the completeness helper (`review_completeness`) all consume this
contract; none of them restate its semantics.

## Required vs optional

Bot participation is classified by two config knobs on the `plan-marshall:automatic-review` step —
`required_bots` and `optional_bots`, each a comma-separated list of `bot_kind` values.

| Classification | Membership | Silence means | Gates the completeness quorum? |
|----------------|-----------|---------------|-------------------------------|
| **Required** | listed in `required_bots` | **A failure.** The bot was expected to review and did not. | **Yes** — a required bot that is still genuinely awaited holds the step open. |
| **Optional** | listed in `optional_bots` | **Not a failure.** The bot is a bonus reviewer; its absence is tolerable. | **No** — an optional bot never blocks mark-done. |
| **Unclassified** | listed in NEITHER | Nothing is expected of it. | **No** — but its comments are **still ingested** and the run records a warning. |

### The warn-but-ingest rule

A bot in neither list is **not** dropped. Its comments flow into the findings store exactly as a
classified bot's do, and the run additionally records a warning naming the unclassified bot. The two
lists carry **classification, not admission**.

This is deliberate. Dropping an unclassified bot's comments would make a configuration omission
silently destroy real review signal — the failure would be invisible precisely when the operator had
not yet thought about that bot. Warning-and-ingesting fails safe: no signal is lost, and the gap in
the configuration is surfaced rather than acted upon.

## The ask posture

`required_bots` and `optional_bots` both default to the **empty string**, and the emptiness is
load-bearing: it keeps a *never-asked* key distinguishable from an *answered-empty* value. Collapsing
the two would make "the operator has not been asked yet" indistinguishable from "the operator
deliberately chose no required bots" — two states that warrant opposite handling.

Three provenance values are recorded:

| Provenance | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| `never_asked` | The wizard has not yet put the question to the operator. The empty value is a placeholder, not an answer. |
| `migrated` | The value was seeded by the one-shot legacy auto-map from a retired `enabled_bots` list, not by an operator answer. |
| `answered` | The operator was asked and answered — **including an explicit answer of none**. An answered-empty value is a real answer and is never re-asked as though it were absent. |

The wizard records an explicit `answered` provenance even when the operator selects no bots at all.
An empty `required_bots` therefore means the quorum is **vacuously satisfied** — there is nothing to
await — and that is a legitimate configured state, not a misconfiguration to warn about.

## Failure taxonomy

When a bot does not deliver a usable review, the non-participation is classified into exactly one of
five members. The taxonomy is closed: every non-participation resolves to one of these.

| Member | Condition | Interpretation |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| `absent` | No comment posted and no completion check-run observed; the review window closed with nothing. | The bot never engaged at all. |
| `in_progress` | The bot's completion check-run is still running when the poll budget expires. | The bot engaged but did not finish in time; left to the pre-merge comment barrier. |
| `refused_awaitable` | The bot posted a refusal whose limit reopens on its own (`rate_limit_class: awaitable_window`). | Worth awaiting — the window resets. |
| `refused_hard` | The bot posted a refusal that does not reopen on a useful timescale (`rate_limit_class: hard_quota`), or a structural refusal such as a size/diff ceiling. | Not worth awaiting; whether the absence is tolerable is a required-vs-optional question, not a waiting question. |
| `participated_but_empty` | The bot posted at least one comment, but every comment was filtered out (noise) so it stored zero findings. | **Accounted-for, not a failure.** The bot did its pass and had nothing actionable to say. |

`participated_but_empty` is the member most often misread. A bot that reviewed and found nothing is a
*successful* review, not a silent one — it must never be treated as an incompleteness, or a clean PR
would hold the step open forever.

### Severity by classification

The taxonomy member describes *what happened*; the required/optional classification decides *whether
it matters*:

- A **required** bot resolving to `absent`, `in_progress`, `refused_awaitable`, or `refused_hard` is
  a completeness failure — the step is not markable done without an explicitly recorded force-done
  reason.
- An **optional** bot resolving to any member never blocks.
- Any bot resolving to `participated_but_empty` is accounted-for regardless of classification.

## Evidence taxonomy

Participation is **evidence-typed, not presence-typed.** The mere existence of a comment resolving to
a bot's login proves nothing about whether that bot reviewed *this diff* — it may be a help reply, a
stale comment from an earlier HEAD, or a marketing footer. A bot counts as a participant only when an
observed comment's `kind` is one of the publish shapes its own registry doc declares in
`participation_evidence`.

### What counts as evidence, per publish shape

| Publish shape | Counts as evidence because | Declared by |
|---------------|---------------------------|-------------|
| `inline` | A per-line comment can only be produced by reading the diff at that line. | CodeRabbit |
| `review_body` | The bot's review summary is emitted by a completed review pass over the diff. | CodeRabbit, Sourcery |
| `issue_comment` | For a bot whose ONLY publish shape is a PR-level comment, that comment *is* its review artifact. | PR-Agent |

The vocabulary is **closed to publish shapes**, and that closure is what enforces the diff-derived
rule below: a publish shape is an artifact the bot produced against the diff, so anything without one
has no admissible evidence kind at all.

A bot whose `participation_evidence` is **empty resolves fail-closed** — it can never be *proven* a
participant, and is reported as `absent` rather than silently credited.

### Why a check-run state is not evidence

A check-run reports that a *job ran*, not that a *review was published*. The two come apart in both
directions, so reading check state as participation is wrong regardless of which way it errs:

- **False negative.** PR-Agent posts **no check-run at all** and submits **no review object** — it
  publishes exactly one persistent Guide comment. Scoring it on check state would mark it absent on
  every run no matter how well it reviewed.
- **False positive.** A check-run can conclude successfully having posted nothing, or having posted
  only a refusal. A green check is not a published review.

Evidence is therefore taken from observed publish shapes only. Check state remains useful for the
*orthogonal* question of whether a bot's review window is still open (`in_progress` in the failure
taxonomy above) — that is a timing signal, not participation evidence.

### Evidence for a bot that edits one comment in place

A bot that re-reviews by **editing its single persistent comment** rather than posting a new one
declares `participation_requires_update: true`. For such a bot the comment's continued existence
proves only that it reviewed **once, at some earlier HEAD** — after a force-push the unchanged
comment would silently credit it with reviewing code it never saw. Its evidence therefore requires
either **first presence** (the comment is newly observed) or observed **`updated_at` movement`**.

## Participation is not review quality

The quorum proves that every required bot **participated**. It never proves the diff was **reviewed
well**, or reviewed meaningfully at all. This ceiling is measured, not theoretical: on #1027 PR-Agent
published its Guide — valid participation under its record — while reporting "no major issues" on a
diff in which CodeRabbit found two Major defects.

**A satisfied quorum MUST NOT be rendered as a reviewed diff.** Every consumer of the participation
verdict is bound by that: the predicate's own envelope carries `proves: participation_only` so the
claim is machine-readable and cannot be read as a quality statement by accident.

Three obligations follow, and they are **normative**, not advisory. They exist because the PR body
carries a distilled **Intent** section, and an Intent section is precisely the kind of input that can
make a shallow review *look* like a real one.

### Obligation 1 — classify intent-echo as participation, not review

A review whose content only **restates or endorses the stated intent** — "this correctly implements
the described change", "looks consistent with the stated goal" — resolves to
`participated_but_empty`. It is participation: the bot ran and said something. It is **never a
satisfied review obligation**, because echoing the intent demonstrates no engagement with the diff.
Crediting an intent-echo as a review would let a PR pass the gate on the strength of its own
description.

### Obligation 2 — an Intent section must never make a review read cleaner

The participation predicate MUST NOT become **more permissive** on a PR whose body carries an Intent
section. An empty review, or a conformance-only review ("matches the stated intent"), must resolve to
exactly the same state it would resolve to on a PR with no Intent section at all.

This is a **parity requirement, discharged by a parity test**: the predicate's verdict for a given
set of observed review artifacts must be **identical-or-stricter** with the Intent section present
than without it. A prose assurance does not discharge it — the test is what proves the predicate did
not quietly soften.

### Obligation 3 — only diff-derived evidence discharges a review obligation

Evidence must be **diff-derived**. A **body-derived signal — anything a reviewer could have produced
by reading the PR description alone** — cannot discharge a review obligation, no matter how confident
or well-formed it is.

This is enforced structurally rather than asserted in prose: the admissible evidence vocabulary is
closed to the publish shapes in the table above, and the PR body is not a publish shape. A
body-derived signal therefore carries **no admissible evidence kind** and cannot be laundered into
the participation set. Unqualified presence (a bare `bot_kind` with no evidence kind) is rejected for
the same reason.

## Detecting a refusal

A refusal is recognised from each bot's own registry doc (`standards/{bot_kind}.md`), via that doc's
`refusal_patterns[]` field — a dedicated per-bot list of the literal notice shapes that bot publishes
when it declines to review.

`refusal_patterns` is deliberately **separate from `ignore_patterns`**. `ignore_patterns` is a
noise filter listing the routine sections a bot emits on a *successful* review (walkthroughs,
learning notices, summary tables); reusing it for refusal detection would classify ordinary
successful reviews as refusals. The two lists answer different questions and must stay distinct.

A bot whose `refusal_patterns[]` is empty has no observed refusal shape; its non-participation
resolves to `absent` or `in_progress` rather than to either refusal member. This is the fail-closed
default — a refusal is only ever claimed on positive evidence.

## Consumers

| Consumer | What it reads |
|----------|---------------|
| `automatic-review/SKILL.md` | Both lists, to drive the completion-aware poll, the re-review trigger set, and the step-done guard. |
| `github_pr fetch_findings` | Both lists, to classify each ingested comment and emit the unclassified-bot warning; each bot's `participation_evidence` / `participation_requires_update`, to derive the evidence-typed `participated_bots[]`. |
| `review_completeness check` | `required_bots` for the quorum; `optional_bots` for reporting only; `participation_evidence` to admit each evidence pair; `rate_limit_class` to split the two refusal states. |
| `marshall-steward` | Both lists, to ask the wizard question and record the provenance. |

See [`../SKILL.md`](../SKILL.md) for the step body that applies this contract and
[`../../manage-config/standards/data-model.md`](../../manage-config/standards/data-model.md) for the
knob storage shape and provenance field.
