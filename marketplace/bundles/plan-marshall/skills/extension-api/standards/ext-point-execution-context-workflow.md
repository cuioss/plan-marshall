# Extension Point: Execution-Context Workflow

> **Type**: Workflow-Doc Extension (declarative, runtime-read) | **Declaration**: `implements:` frontmatter on workflow doc or SKILL.md | **Status**: Active

## Overview

The `ext-point-execution-context-workflow` extension point declares that a marketplace doc is dispatchable as a workflow by `plan-marshall:execution-context-{level}`. It is the consumer-side companion to `ext-point-dynamic-level-executor` (which governs the dispatcher agent itself).

When a workflow doc declares this extension point, it asserts conformance to the prompt-body input contract, the return-TOON output contract, and the addressing convention defined below. The execution-context dispatcher reads the `workflow` field in its prompt body as a `{bundle}:{skill}/workflow/{file}.md` or `{bundle}:{skill}/SKILL.md` notation, resolves it to a filesystem path, and `Read`s the file — implementors of this ext-point are the legal targets of that `Read`.

## Implementor Requirements

### Frontmatter Declaration

```yaml
---
implements: plan-marshall:extension-api/standards/ext-point-execution-context-workflow
---
```

### Addressing

The implementor MUST live at one of these paths:

| Notation | Resolves to |
|----------|-------------|
| `{bundle}:{skill}/SKILL.md` | `marketplace/bundles/{bundle}/skills/{skill}/SKILL.md` |
| `{bundle}:{skill}/workflow/{file}.md` | `marketplace/bundles/{bundle}/skills/{skill}/workflow/{file}.md` |

The `workflow/` directory (singular) is the marketplace convention for workflow docs. Reference / contract / configuration docs live under `standards/`; tool-loaded reference material lives under `references/`.

Every file under `workflow/` MUST be a `.md` markdown file. There is no orchestrator-exception: even top-level workflows the LLM follows directly in the main context (e.g., `plan-marshall/workflow/planning.md`, `recipe.md`, `execution.md`) declare the ext-point — their Output section is degenerate (a `status` + `display_detail` shape emitted when the workflow is wrapped in a `Task: execution-context-{level}` dispatch; interactive entry surfaces the same conceptual state via `manage-logging` records and the terminal user message).

A skill MAY hold zero, one, or many `workflow/*.md` files. A SKILL.md MAY itself implement the ext-point when the skill's primary deliverable is one workflow (e.g., the six phase-N skills). When both apply, SKILL.md typically describes the skill and points at one or more `workflow/*.md` implementors that carry the actual dispatch bodies.

**Cross-phase / multi-consumer placement rule**: when a workflow is consumed from multiple phases or from outside any phase (e.g., `triage`, `q-gate-validation`, `research-best-practices`, `enrich-module`), place it under `plan-marshall/skills/plan-marshall/workflow/` rather than under any single consumer phase. Single-phase workflows live under the consumer phase's `skill/workflow/`.

### Workflow-Resolution Root

The `workflow` field in a `Task:` prompt body is resolved against the **installed plugin cache** — `~/.claude/plugins/cache/plan-marshall/skills/{skill}/workflow/{file}.md` or `…/skills/{skill}/SKILL.md` — by the dispatched `plan-marshall:execution-context-{level}` agent. Resolution is never performed against:

- the active worktree path (e.g., `.plan/local/worktrees/{plan_id}/marketplace/bundles/plan-marshall/skills/…`),
- the main checkout's `marketplace/bundles/` tree,
- any other filesystem root supplied at dispatch time.

The cache is the single resolution root for every workflow load, regardless of `WORKTREE` value or call site. `WORKTREE` governs where the dispatched workflow's tool calls (Edit / Write / Read / `git -C`) act; it does NOT govern where the workflow body itself is loaded from.

**Consequence — stale dispatch until cache sync + session restart**: a plan that modifies a `workflow/*.md` or `SKILL.md` in its worktree sees the **pre-change** version of that file at every dispatch site until BOTH of the following hold:

1. The plugin cache has been synced from the worktree (via `/sync-plugin-cache` or `project:finalize-step-sync-plugin-cache`), and
2. The Claude Code session has been restarted so the host platform re-reads the cache instead of serving its in-process registry snapshot.

This is the second of the three failure surfaces described in [`../../phase-6-finalize/standards/self-host-blind-spot.md`](../../phase-6-finalize/standards/self-host-blind-spot.md). The structural enforcement that prevents the dispatcher from advancing past a worktree-modified workflow before both conditions hold is the session-restart fence in [`../../phase-6-finalize/SKILL.md`](../../phase-6-finalize/SKILL.md) § Session-Restart Fence.

### Input Contract — what the implementor can rely on

Every dispatch into the implementor delivers, via the parent dispatcher (`plan-marshall:execution-context-{level}`):

| Field | Always present | Description |
|-------|:--------------:|-------------|
| `plan_id` | Yes | Plan identifier; sentinel `none` for free-standing dispatches. |
| `WORKTREE` | Yes | Repo-relative working directory; `.` for main checkout. |
| `skills[]` | Yes | Caller-loaded skills, loaded before the workflow body runs. May be empty. |
| `plan-marshall:dev-general-practices` | Yes (implicit) | Loaded by the dispatcher before any caller-specified skill. |

Workflow-specific runtime inputs (e.g., `finding_type`, `track`, `scope`) flow through additional prompt-body fields the implementor declares in its own input table.

### Output Contract — what the implementor MUST return

```toon
status: success | error | loop_back | blocked
display_detail: "<≤80 char ASCII summary, no trailing period>"
```

Plus any workflow-specific return fields the implementor declares. The `status` and `display_detail` fields are mandatory on every return — including error returns.

The `display_detail` field is the orchestrator-facing one-line summary surfaced by `manage-status mark-step-done`, the output-template renderer, and metrics. It MUST:

- be ≤ 80 characters;
- be ASCII-only;
- end without a trailing period.

These constraints are structural — the renderer truncates or rejects values that violate them. They live here as the single source of truth and are NOT redeclared per-workflow.

### Forbidden

The implementor MUST NOT carry inline prose stating "Dispatched via `Task: plan-marshall:execution-context-{level}` with this doc as `workflow`." That statement is the ext-point's job; the `implements:` declaration replaces it.

The implementor MUST NOT redeclare `dev-general-practices` in its own steps — the dispatcher loads it implicitly.

## Sub-dispatch contract

Some workflow implementors fire **further** `execution-context` dispatches from inside their running envelope (not from the orchestrator's main context). Examples: a phase-N body kicking off `research` mid-flow, a `verification-feedback` envelope sub-dispatching itself on overflow, or any workflow that internally branches into a sub-workflow while the caller's phase context is still relevant.

The sub-dispatch must resolve the level via the **caller's phase**, not via `--default`. The mechanism is encoded in two prompt-body fields:

1. **The `name:` field.** A subagent's incoming `name:` frontmatter typically encodes the caller phase implicitly:
   - `name: phase-2-refine` → caller phase is `phase-2-refine`
   - `name: verification-feedback` AND `workflow: …/phase-5-execute/…` → caller phase is `phase-5-execute`
   - For any sub-dispatch this subagent issues, it extracts the phase prefix from its own `name:` (or from its `workflow:` notation) and passes `--phase <caller-phase>` to `manage-config effort resolve-target`.

2. **The optional `caller_phase:` field (6th-field extension of the canonical 5-field contract).** When the parent's `name:` does not naturally encode the phase (for example, a workflow that fires from multiple phases such as `verification-feedback` or `q-gate-validation`), the parent's prompt body MUST include `caller_phase: phase-N` explicitly. Subagents forward `caller_phase` verbatim to any sub-dispatch they issue.

The 5-field contract (`name`, `plan_id`, `skills[]`, `workflow`, `WORKTREE`) is unchanged for top-level dispatches that have an unambiguous phase home. `caller_phase` is the 6th field used only by workflows that need to propagate phase context through one or more sub-dispatch hops.

The resolver already accepts `--phase <P>` from any caller — this is a documentation extension, not a runtime change.

## Plugin-Doctor Enforcement

The lint rule `workflow-doc-implements-contract` enforces every requirement in this document by filesystem glob plus frontmatter check: the `implements:` frontmatter is present, the Output section declares at minimum `status` and `display_detail`, and the Forbidden constraints above are honoured. Cheap enough to run as part of the marketplace quality gate.
