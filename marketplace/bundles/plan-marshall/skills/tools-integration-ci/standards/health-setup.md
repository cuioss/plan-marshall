# Health Check & Setup

Provider detection, tool verification, and configuration persistence.

## Exit-code convention for every script call

Every `python3 .plan/execute-script.py` call in this document — of EVERY notation, **not only `manage-*`** — carries the following exit-code contract unless a step explicitly states otherwise. The scope is widened past `manage-*` because this document invokes `ci_health` — a `manage-*`-scoped convention leaves exactly those calls with no rule at all, which is the swallowed-rejection gap.

- **`exit_code == 0` AND `status: success`**: parse the returned TOON and use the value as the step describes.
- **`exit_code == 0` with a `status` other than `success`, or with no parseable `status` at all**: NOT a usable value — STOP exactly as the `exit_code != 0` disposition below requires, with one difference in what the error TOON carries: on this path the diagnostic is on STDOUT, not stderr. Preserve the stdout **error envelope** as emitted — every field it carries, verbatim — into the returned error TOON; it is the only account of the cause that exists. Copy the whole envelope rather than a fixed field list, because the diagnostic fields vary by verb and `error` is sometimes a generic string whose real cause sits in one of the others. A zero exit is not evidence the operation succeeded; a script MAY print `status: error` and still exit 0. Read `status` FIRST, and never read a **success-payload** field off a non-`success` return. A malformed or truncated stdout carrying **no parseable `status` at all** takes this same path: an unreadable read is not evidence of success, so it fails closed onto STOP rather than falling through to the first clause.
- **`exit_code != 0`**: STOP and return an error TOON to the orchestrator carrying the script's stderr verbatim. Non-zero exits include `argparse_rejection` (exit 2) — silent swallowing of `wrong_parameters` rejections is the prohibited anti-pattern; "log and continue" is equally forbidden.

The middle clause is what the `ci` family makes load-bearing: a `ci` verb reports failure as `status: error` at exit 0 **by design**, so a caller must branch on the payload `status` and never on the exit code. That rule is stated authoritatively in `plan-marshall:tools-integration-ci`; it is not restated here.

Step-level exceptions — calls whose non-zero exit is itself the signal — are documented inline in the step that issues them.

## Workflow: Health Check

**Pattern**: Command Chain Execution

Detect CI provider and verify tools are available and authenticated.

### Step 1: Run Health Check

```bash
python3 .plan/execute-script.py plan-marshall:tools-integration-ci:ci_health status
```

### Step 2: Process Result

```toon
status: success
provider: github
repo_url: https://github.com/org/repo
confidence: high
required_tool: gh
required_tool_ready: true
overall: healthy

tools[2]{name,installed,authenticated}:
git	true	true
gh	true	true
```

## Workflow: Detect Provider

**Pattern**: Command Chain Execution

Detect CI provider from git remote URL.

### Step 1: Run Detection

```bash
python3 .plan/execute-script.py plan-marshall:tools-integration-ci:ci_health detect
```

### Step 2: Process Result

```toon
status: success
provider: github
repo_url: https://github.com/org/repo
confidence: high
```

---

## Workflow: Live Verify

**Pattern**: Command Chain Execution

Detect provider and verify CI tools live — no persistence, since tool/auth status is cheap to check on demand and varies per machine.

### Step 1: Run verify-all

```bash
python3 .plan/execute-script.py plan-marshall:tools-integration-ci:ci_health verify-all
```

### Step 2: Process Result

```toon
status: success
provider: github
repo_url: https://github.com/org/repo
authenticated_tools[1]:
- gh
git_present: true
```

## Storage Pattern

| File | Content | Shared |
|------|---------|--------|
| `.plan/marshal.json` | CI provider entry in `providers[]` array (`provider`, `repo_url`, `detected_at`) | Yes (git) |
| `.plan/run-configuration.json` | Command timeouts and learned warnings | No (local) |

CI tool authentication status is verified live via `ci_health verify-all` — not persisted. CI operations are resolved at runtime by the `ci.py` router which finds the system CI entry in the `providers[]` array of marshal.json and delegates to the correct provider script.

## Tool Requirements

| Provider | CLI Tool | Auth Check |
|----------|----------|------------|
| github | `gh` | `gh auth status` |
| gitlab | `glab` | `glab auth status` |
