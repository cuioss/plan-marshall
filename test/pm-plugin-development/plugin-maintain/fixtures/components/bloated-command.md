# Bloated Command

This command has too much content and demonstrates bloat issues.

## Purpose

This is a very long purpose section that goes into excessive detail about what the command does. It repeats information multiple times and includes unnecessary background information that doesn't help users understand the command better. The purpose section should be concise but this one rambles on and on about things that aren't directly relevant.

Furthermore, it continues to explain things that are already obvious from the command name and description. This is a clear example of bloat where content is added without adding value.

## Workflow

### Step 1: First Step

This step does something important but the description is unnecessarily verbose and repeats information from the purpose section.

### Step 2: Second Step

Another step that could be described more concisely but instead uses many words to say simple things.

### Step 3: Third Step

Yet another verbose step description.

### Step 4: Fourth Step

More unnecessary detail.

### Step 5: Fifth Step

Even more content that adds to the bloat.

### Step 6: Sixth Step

The pattern continues with excessive detail.

### Step 7: Seventh Step

Still more verbose descriptions.

### Step 8: Eighth Step

This workflow has too many steps for a simple command.

### Step 9: Ninth Step

Commands should be more focused.

### Step 10: Tenth Step

This demonstrates poor organization.

## Background Information

This section provides background that should really be in documentation, not in the command file itself. It goes into great detail about the history of the feature.

## Additional Context

More context that doesn't belong in a command file.

## Implementation Details

Technical details that should be elsewhere.

## Related Information

Cross-references and related content that bloat the file.

## Extended Examples

### Example 1

A very long example with extensive commentary.

### Example 2

Another example with too much detail.

### Example 3

Yet another example.

### Example 4

Still more examples than needed.

### Example 5

Commands typically need 2-3 examples, not 5+.

Extensive notes section.

Even an appendix section which is unusual for a command.
