"""Tests for workflow-integration-github github_pr.py — two-verb provider contract.

The provider surface is exactly two pure verbs (plus the raw ``fetch-comments``):

- ``fetch-comments`` — raw GraphQL fetch (no filtering, no storage)
- ``fetch_findings`` — fetch + pre-filter + file one ``pr-comment`` finding per
  surviving comment; the untrusted body is quarantined under ``raw_input.{body}``
- ``post_responses`` — apply already-decided triage dispositions (thread-reply +
  resolve-thread) back to the PR, keyed by each finding's own ``hash_id``

These tests cover the producer-side pre-filter helper, the fetch_findings flow
(with the body quarantined in raw_input and structured metadata in detail), the
classification of reviewer-bot REFUSAL notices across the arms of the
recognition stack (``_github_pr.REFUSAL_LAYERS`` names them), the fail-loud
unconfigured signal,
the hash_id-keyed post_responses respond loop, the ``--project-dir`` plumbing,
and the CLI surface contract (the retired ``triage`` / ``triage-batch`` /
``comments-stage`` subcommands MUST be gone).
